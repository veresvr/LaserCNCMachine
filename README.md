# Laser CNC Machine

#### This machine was designed to reduce the labor intensity of PCB manufacturing. 
In this design, the moving element is a carriage, which moves on a structural profile by means of belts and NEMA 17HS4401 stepper motors. 
The dimensions of the working area are 260 x 265 and the maximum height is 32 mm.
I also thought it would be nice to develop a [carriage with a motor] to use as a drilling/milling machine.
