# Laser CNC Machine

This machine is not something special, just DIY.
Firstly I planned to use a laser but its so easy, so I desided to build milling carriage, like [this]:<https://github.com/veresvr/SpindleCarriageForCNC>.
Also here is [Control Box]:<https://github.com/veresvr/SpindleCarriageForCNC> for it.
