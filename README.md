# Laser CNC Machine

This machine is not something special, just DIY.
Firstly I planned to use a laser but its so easy, so I decided to build milling carriage, like [this](https://github.com/veresvr/SpindleCarriageForCNC).
Also here is [Control Box](https://github.com/veresvr/SpindleCarriageForCNC) for it.
BOM and drawings for the machine [here](https://github.com/veresvr/SpindleCarriageForCNC/tree/main/ProductionFiles/LaserCNCMachine.pdf).
